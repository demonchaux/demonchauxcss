When the Nazi Wehrmacht started the operational launching of V-2 rockets against London and Antwerp in 1944, the launch infrastructure was, ingeniously, temporary. A system of wagons and portable platforms were used to erect a launch site in under 24 hours &ndash; the better to evade Allied detection and bombing &ndash; and the site was rapidly disassembled after the rocket had been launched. In order to camouflage the 40&rsquo; tall rocket, launches were staged in forests, or, just as as often, in high-rise urban neighborhoods (in for instance the Hauge.) </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../../../../media/mce_filebrowser/2014/01/27/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"730\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>NASA photo 61-MR3-72</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">To really get to the iconography of launch </span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>buildings</em></span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"> we need to move to the United States and Soviet Union after the Second World War. But let&rsquo;s stop first for a moment to consider America&rsquo;s first manned space rocket, Mercury-Redstone, which launched Alan Shepard into a ballistic orbit like Virgin&rsquo;s SpaceshipTwo; while Mercury-Redstone&rsquo;s form was very different from the V-2, its launching process was exactly the same, including the temporary &ldquo;firing table&rdquo; or </span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>Abschussplattform</em></span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"> from which the rocket was launched.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../../../../media/mce_filebrowser/2014/01/27/4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"972\" height=\"768\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>NASA image KSC-65C-3814</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Even as Alan Shepard was launched from a V2 </span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>Abschussplattform</em></span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">, American-sized rockets had grown American-sized buildings, and landscapes, the heritage of which is visible specifically in Foster&rsquo;s Spaceport. The desert that shroud the structures&rsquo; back against the New Mexico desert, (giving the building a front but no rear), explicitly recalls this architecture in form and site. Starting with John Glenn&rsquo;s flight, the U.S. joined the Soviet Union in launching astronauts on modified Nuclear ICBMs &ndash; Inter-continental ballistic missiles, a whole order larger in size and destructive power than the Redstone. For these missiles a more complex infrastructure was developed in the 1950s, of blockhouses and berms borrowed from airfields and artillery ranges, a constructed landscape that allowed a protection from the intended or unintended explosive potential of these fearsome firecrackers. (Unlike the United States, the Soviet Union developed no other architecture to launch its &lsquo;civilian&rsquo; missiles; Russian visits to the International space station start, like Gagarin&rsquo;s first flight, with the slow winching of a modified ICBM to the vertical, above a shifting, sloped landscape in the former Soviet Union&rsquo;s largest desert.)</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../../../../media/mce_filebrowser/2014/01/27/5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"517\" height=\"400\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>NASA image 64-Complex 39-20</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">If its back berms into rocketry&rsquo;s past, what of Foster&rsquo;s Spaceport&rsquo;s Front? One thing it does not resemble is the elaborate system of Vehicle Assembly Buildings, Crawlers, and Gantries used to launch American Space shots from John Glenn&rsquo;s onwards. These structures were products of the massive, and public nature of the American space effort, in which the massive and monolithic apparatus of spaceflight was a public relations, as well as infrastructural necessity (it was Eisenhower himself who decreed that U.S. rockets should be white, and marked only with &lsquo;USA&rsquo; instead of the logos of their military-industrial manufacturers). In the case of Foster&rsquo;s spaceport, the omission is especially thought-provoking given the direct lineage between Foster&rsquo;s own &lsquo;high-tech&rsquo; architectural heritage in the United Kingdom, and the infrastructure as well as structure of US spaceflight. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../../../../media/mce_filebrowser/2014/01/27/6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"661\" height=\"285\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>Sainsbury Center, 1977, Foster and Partners</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Unlike the American architectural press, where the strange and beautiful structures of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo received barely a mention from in the 15 years of their public life, British architectural audiences were rapt (the influential London journal </span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>Architectural Design</em></span><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"> devoted its entire February 1967 issue to the U.S. space program.) While the phantasmagoric design studies that followed from British practitioners (&ldquo;Cushicles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instant Cities&rdquo;) did not immediately see construction, their megastructural trusswork, and NASA&rsquo;s, was echoed explicitly by Norman Foster and his contemporary Richard Rogers in projects like Paris&rsquo; Pompidou center (Rogers &amp; Renzo Piano), and Foster&rsquo;s own reputation-making projects, the Sainsbury Center, and Renault Facility in Swindon.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\">&nbsp;<img src=\"../../../../media/mce_filebrowser/2014/01/27/7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"400\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>Beijing Airport (2008), Foster and Partners</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Really, however, this &lsquo;spaceport&rsquo; wants to be, visually at least, an entirely different beast &ndash; a simple Airport. Here the precedent is Foster&rsquo;s own mastery of the genre; Starting from his Stansted Airport near Cambridge (1981-1991), Foster has remade the genre, articulating a system of light roofs, and hidden, submerged infrastructure and suppressed structure, and adaptable circulation refined and extended in Hong Kong, (Chep Lak Lok, 1992-1998), and Beijing (on track for 2008). These spaces are futuristic, yes, but represent the modern evolution of a architectural type associated no longer with uncertain futurism, but with a global but everyday system of mundane transport. Predictable, uncomfortable, and at least in Foster&rsquo;s hands, fluidly beautiful.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><img src=\"../../../../media/mce_filebrowser/2014/01/27/8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1339\" height=\"1088\" /><br /><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\"><em>McDonell-Douglas, Shuttle Rendering, 1972</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Which recalls another association, as strange as it may seem &ndash; the way in which the dream of air travel haunts space flight. From Werner Von Brauns&rsquo; post-sputnik proposals in Collier&rsquo;s magazine, to the Air Force&rsquo;s failed &ldquo;Dyna-Soar&rdquo; vehicle, and especially to the ill-fated Space Shuttle, an airplane image has been used consistently by those who have sought to make the complex technological systems of spaceflight seem predictable, and &ndash; as is explicitly the case with Virgin&rsquo;s call for high-flying passengers, safe. The space shuttle &ndash; &ldquo;Nixon&rsquo;s gift to the space program,&rdquo; &ndash; has never lived up to its advertising; Even on its first, rocket-like launch in 1981, we were told, its launches would quickly become routine, the cost per pound of payload $20. The reality, of course, was (grimly) different. As they bid for the multi-billion dollar contract to build the Shuttle, and sought to convince NASA and the public that the complexities and uncertainties of large-scale technological systems could be overcome (despite explicit evidence to the contrary in Apollo&rsquo;s own history), Military-Industiral contractors like Boeing and North American turned to images not just of the Shuttle&rsquo;s airplane-like design, but supplemented their proposals with a Richard-Scarry-esqe collection of renderings showing the Shuttle hanging out in hangars, being fueled, serviced and crewed with the everyday infrastructure of Air Travel.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">Should the shiny hangars of 1975&rsquo;s shuttle renderings be filed together with Foster&rsquo;s silvery spaceport? In one regard, they certainly should. Unlike the spaceman-and-gantry renderings of 1960s architecture, which sought to bring the spectacle of spaceflight to a new, spectacular way of life on earth, the heavenly hangars rendered in the 1970s as now seek a much more ambitious goal; to convince us, by shrouding the audacity and complexity of human travel above the atmosphere in the humdrum of air travel, that we can control the uncertain reality of spaceflight with the simple outlines of its architectural frame. Like other yesterday&rsquo;s tomorrow&rsquo;s however &ndash; nuclear airplanes, fusion-fried chicken, dare we say the flying car? &ndash; it should give us pause when proposed as the present.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><span style=\"font-family: Georgia;\">For more on the Spaceport building, see <a title=\"Test\" href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/Projects/1613/Default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fosterandpartners.com/Projects/1613/Default.aspx</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"western\"><br /><br /></p>", "post_type": "b", "image_path": "images/test_1.png", "json_path": ""}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "base.post", "fields": {"headline": "Daniel Clowes", "body": "<p>The design for this exhibit was developed in collaboration with the cartoonist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://danielclowes.com/\">Daniel Clowes</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162346\">Ghost World,</a>&nbsp;Wilson,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364955/\">Art School Confidential</a>).
